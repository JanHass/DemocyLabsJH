## Documentation

Check the ongoing documentation at [https://docs.consulproject.org](https://docs.consulproject.org) to learn more about how to start your own CONSUL fork, install it, customize it and learn to use it from an administrator/maintainer perspective.

## CONSUL Project main website

You can access the main website of the project at [http://consulproject.org](http://consulproject.org) where you can find documentation about the use of the platform, videos, and links to the community space.

Prerequisites: install git, Ruby 2.7.4, CMake, pkg-config, shared-mime-info, Node.js and PostgreSQL (>=9.5).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/consul/consul.git
cd consul
bundle install
cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml
cp config/secrets.yml.example config/secrets.yml
bin/rake db:create
